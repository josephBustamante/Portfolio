This is the portfolio for Joseph Bustamante. I am currently a 3rd year student at Drake University. I have had a year of iOS programming experience, 2 years of C++, a year of Visual Basic, some experience with Perl, Yacc, Machine Code, AI, and various other languages. I have done a lot of different programs over the years, and these are a few examples of my iOS programs.
